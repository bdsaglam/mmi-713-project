2. Term Paper Guideline
Suggested guidelines for writing your report are as follows:
i. Abstract
Try to include the following:
• Motivation: one or two sentences on the problem and it significance;
• Results: a short paragraph on approach and results;
• Availability: a link to code, data, and supplementary materials, or a statement why this
is not possible.
ii. Motivation & Significance
What is the problem and why is it important or significant?
iii. Problem Statement
Formal definition of the problem with any preliminary concepts.
iv. Prior Work & Limitations
What are the existing approaches, and their limitations?
v. Theory/Algorithm
• Discuss the main theoretical or algorithmic ideas of the paper;
• Mention the main theorems (if any), the intuition behind those, and their practical
application. Move the proofs to the appendix, unless the proof itself is the main
contribution;
• Discuss your algorithmic solution (if any) at the conceptual level with pseudo-code, to
convey the main ideas. Move minute (but practically important) implementation
details to the appendix;
• Discuss why you chose certain paths, and discuss unfruitful paths that you discarded.
In other words, give both the theoretical and/or algorithmic insights into your work.
vi. Experiments or other Evidence of Success
• Complete parameter settings and data descriptions should be provided (including any
links to public resources);
• Clearly specify the experimental procedure, including evaluation measures;
• Compare to prior solutions, or at least to strawman solutions;
• Clearly discuss the results and what they mean;
• Only include the most relevant experiments here, using the appendix to provide any
additional results (say on minor parameter tuning of your method, etc).7 | P a g e

vii. Discussion and Future Work
Describe insights you gained, the limitations and applicability of your work, and
directions for future research. Every solution has limitations, which should be
explicitly mentioned.
viii. References
Include the most relevant works, making sure all citations are complete (including
editors, publishers, page numbers, etc.).
ix. APPENDIX
You should use the appendix for supporting details. For example, you may use it to
convey detailed technical/practical aspects of your implementation. You may use the
appendix for theorem proofs, or for additional experimental results. Include include
pointers in the main paper to relevant sections in the appendix.
The appendix is an integral part of the paper, since it will provide details that are
important for a proper appreciation of your work (e.g., for replicating or extending it,
or for comparison). However, it should be possible on a first read-through to get a
good understanding of the paper's contribution from the main part alone. Structuring
the paper in this way provides a service to the reader, by separating main ideas from
technical details.
